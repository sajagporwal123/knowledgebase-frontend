# Knowledge Base

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Prerequisites

Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require Node 8.9 or higher, together
with NPM 5.5.1 or higher.

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

### Install Globally
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Install Locally
```bash
npm install @angular/cli
```
To run a locally installed version of the angular-cli, you can call `ng` commands directly by adding the `.bin` folder within your local `node_modules` folder to your PATH. The `node_modules` and `.bin` folders are created in the directory where `npm install @angular/cli` was run upon completion of the install command.

Alternatively, you can install [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and run `npx ng <command>` within the local directory where `npm install @angular/cli` was run, which will use the locally installed angular-cli.
